Use the earlier description I gave; integrate sections: Features, Tech Stack, Usage, etc.

Add Installation steps: how to clone, install dependencies, run the code.

Add Usage: how to make predictions, what inputs are expected.

Add Dataset section: mention what data you used (source, preprocessing).

Add Results: show performance metrics (accuracy, recall/precision) and maybe a simple table.

Add Future Work: mention how you plan to extend (e.g., web app / mobile app / more data).

Add License: choose an open-source license (MIT is common).

Add Badges: e.g., CI build status, license, issues, language.
